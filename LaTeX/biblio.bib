In regions with sea ice the SST is the temperature of open water or of the water under the ice. A number of different proxy SST estimates based on SIC have been developed. In recent years more Arctic quality-control buoy SSTs have become available, allowing better validation of different estimates and the development of improved proxy estimates. Here proxy SSTs from different approaches are evaluated and an improved proxy SST method is shown. The improved proxy SSTs were tested in an SST analysis, and showed reduced bias and random errors compared to the Arctic buoy SSTs. Almost all reduction in errors is in the warm melt season. In the cold season the SIC is typically high and all estimates tend to have low errors. The improved method will be incorporated into an operational SST analysis.}},

Next, an expression for the available gravitational potential energy in the oceans is derived. The computed amounts of zonal mean and transient eddy available potential energy and the amount of kinetic energy present in the oceans are found to be much smaller (at least 1 order of magnitude) than those in the atmosphere. Because of the sparseness of directly measured subsurface values, the estimates of the kinetic energy and the transient eddy available potential energy were obtained by extrapolation from the corresponding values measured at the ocean surface. The fact that relatively large density variations are found only in the upper few hundred meters of the oceans and the greater stability of the oceans are the basic reasons for the generally small values of the potential and kinetic energy in the oceans compared with those in the atmosphere.},

  abstract={In the Southern Ocean, strong eastward ocean jets interact with large topographic features, generating eddies that feed back onto the mean flow. Deep-reaching eddies interact with topography, where turbulent dissipation and generation of internal lee waves play an important role in the ocean’s energy budget. However, eddy effects in the deep ocean are difficult to observe and poorly characterized. This study investigates the energy contained in eddies at depth, when an ocean jet encounters topography. This study uses a two-layer ocean model in which an imposed unstable jet encounters a topographic obstacle (either a seamount or a meridional ridge) in a configuration relevant to an Antarctic Circumpolar Current frontal jet. The authors find that the presence of topography increases the eddy kinetic energy {(EKE)} at depth but that the dominant processes generating this deep {EKE} depend on the shape and height of the obstacle as well as on the baroclinicity of the jet before it encounters topography. In cases with high topography, horizontal shear instability is the dominant source of deep {EKE,} while a flat bottom or a strongly sheared inflow leads to deep {EKE} being generated primarily through baroclinic instability. These results suggest that the deep {EKE} is set by an interplay between the inflowing jet properties and topography and imply that the response of deep {EKE} to changes in the Southern Ocean circulation is likely to vary across locations depending on the topography characteristics.},

Yet in comparison with processes in the North Atlantic, the overall Agulhas system is largely overlooked as a potential climate trigger or feedback mechanism. Detailed modelling experiments—backed by palaeoceanographic and sustained modern observations—are required to establish firmly the role of the Agulhas system in a warming climate.},

  abstract={Observations of surface drift currents made by merchant ships are used to calculate the kinetic energy of the mean flow as well as the kinetic energy of the fluctuations, which is interpreted as eddy kinetic energy. The distribution of these properties is charted for the North Atlantic Ocean based on 1{\textdegree} squares and for the world oceans based on 5{\textdegree} squares. Both distributions show essentially the same features, namely, high values in the western boundary currents and in the equatorial current system and low values in the subtropical gyres. The ratio between mean energy and eddy energy is high (about 1 to 2) in the strong currents and low (about 1/20 to 1/40) in the central and eastern portions of the gyres. Comparing mean and eddy energies in ocean and atmosphere, it becomes apparent that eddy energies in the two systems are uncorrelated. The results are consistent with the idea that eddy motion in the ocean is generated in areas of strong mean shear flow and is subsequently distributed over the whole ocean.},

  title={{E}nergy partition in the large-scale ocean circulation and the production of mid-ocean eddies},
  abstract={It is shown that the available potential energy in the large-scale mean ocean circulation, excluding the boundary layers, is of order {(Ba)2} times the kinetic energy, where B is the basin dimension and a = cf is the internal radius of deformation (c is the speed of long internal waves and f the Coriolis parameter). This ratio is of order 1000. The Sverdrup solution for a two-layer ocean is examined, and the rate of input of energy by the wind estimated. In the steady-state model, this energy is lost to the western boundary layer. It is then shown that potential energy available in the mean circulation can be converted into eddy energy by baroclinic instability. The stability properties depend only on the mean density field, and calculations are made for a number of cases. Maximum growth rates are obtained for eddies with wavelength of about 200 km, typical e-folding times being about 80 days. These eddies have significant velocities only in the surface layers. Secondary maxima in the growth rate curves are found for eddies with wavelengths of 300–500 km, e-folding times being 120 days or more. These eddies have significant velocities in deep water, their structure being something like that of the first baroclinic {mode.In} the models examined, the conversion of available potential energy took place in the upper 400 m, and the rate of conversion can be related to the maximum eddy velocity. If it is supposed that eddies grow to such a size that mean energy is lost to eddies as fast as it is supplied by the large-scale wind field, then the larger eddies would have maximum velocities of about 0{\textperiodcentered}08 m s−1 and the smaller surface trapped eddies would have maximum velocities of about 0{\textperiodcentered}14 m s−1. Observations indicate the existence of eddies of this strength, and with wavelength and periods of the same order as given by the baroclinic instability calculations.},

  title={{S}ubmesoscale processes and dynamics},
  abstract={Increased spatial resolution in recent observations and modeling has revealed 
 a richness of structure and processes on lateral scales of a kilometer in the upper 
 ocean. Processes at this scale, termed submesoscale, are distinguished by order-one 
 {(O(1))} Rossby and Richardson numbers; their dynamics are distinct from those of 
 the largely quasi-geostrophic mesoscale as well as fully three-dimensional, small-
 scale processes. Submesoscale processes make an important contribution to the 
 vertical ux of mass, buoyancy, and tracers in the upper ocean. They ux potential 
 vorticity through the mixed layer, enhance communication between the pycnocline 
 and surface, and play a crucial role in changing the upper-ocean stratication and 
 mixed-layer structure on a timescale of days. In this review, we present a synthesis 
 of  upper-ocean  submesoscale  processes  that  arise  in  the  presence  of  lateral 
 buoyancy gradients. We describe their generation through frontogenesis, unforced 
 instabilities, and forced motions due to buoyancy loss or down-front winds. Using 
 the  semi-geostrophic  {(SG)}  framework,  we  present  physical  arguments  to  help 
 interpret several key aspects of submesoscale ows. These include the development 
 of narrow elongated regions with O(1) Rossby and Richardson numbers through 
 frontogenesis, intense vertical velocities with a downward bias at these sites, and 
 secondary circulations that redistribute buoyancy to stratify the mixed layer. We 
 review some of the rst parameterizations for submesoscale processes that attempt 
 to capture their contribution to, rst, vertical buoyancy uxes and restratication by 
 mixed-layer instabilities and, second, the exchange of potential vorticity between 
 the wind- and buoyancy-forced surface mixed layer, and pycnocline. Submesoscale 
 processes are emerging as vital for the transport of biogeochemical properties, for 
generating spatial hetergeneity that is iritial for biogeochemial processes and 
 mixing, and for the transfer of energy from meso- to small scales. Several studies 
 are  in  progress  to  model,  measure,  analyze,  understand,  and  parameterize  these 
 motions.},

  title={{B}ringing physics to life at the submesoscale},
  abstract={A common dynamical paradigm is that turbulence in the upper ocean is dominated by three classes of motion: mesoscale geostrophic eddies, internal waves and microscale three-dimensional turbulence. Close to the ocean surface, however, a fourth class of turbulent motion is important: submesoscale frontal dynamics. These have a horizontal scale of O(1–10) km, a vertical scale of O(100) m, and a time scale of O(1) day. Here we review the physical-chemical-biological dynamics of submesoscale features, and discuss strategies for sampling them. Submesoscale fronts arise dynamically through nonlinear instabilities of the mesoscale currents. They are ephemeral, lasting only a few days after they are formed. Strong submesoscale vertical velocities can drive episodic nutrient pulses to the euphotic zone, and subduct organic carbon into the ocean's interior. The reduction of vertical mixing at submesoscale fronts can locally increase the mean time that photosynthetic organisms spend in the well-lit euphotic layer and promote primary production. Horizontal stirring can create intense patchiness in planktonic species. Submesoscale dynamics therefore can change not only primary and export production, but also the structure and the functioning of the planktonic ecosystem. Because of their short time and space scales, sampling of submesoscale features requires new technologies and approaches. This paper presents a critical overview of current knowledge to focus attention and hopefully interest on the pressing scientific questions concerning these dynamics.},

Part of the flow seperating from the coast was recirculated to the north and the remainder flowed east. There was some indication that cyclonic eddies seen north of this easterly flow drifted to the west. In the southern part, anticyclonic eddies were the dominant features and, in the second half of the year, two of these formed and interconnected pair.

Altimeter-data analyses have produced global, quantitative estimates of eddy energy with high spatial resolution, revealing details—such as the correlation of eddy kinetic energy {(EKE)—with} the mean currents and the role of the bathymetry. They have provided, for the first time, a global description of the seasonal/interannual variations in eddy energy.

In the past few years, a number of technical developments have taken place that might permit the establishment by the 1990s of an observational system approaching these requirements. We focus here on two major components of such a hypothetical system: ocean acoustic tomography, and satellite observations of sea surface topography and of wind stress. These, combined with other types of observations and with a sensibly designed modelling effort, might provide an ocean-observing system at not unreasonable cost.

  abstract={The mean vertical structure of mesoscale eddies in the {Peru-Chile} Current System is investigated by combining the historical records of Argo float profiles and satellite altimetry data. A composite average of 420 (526) profiles acquired by Argo floats that surfaced into cyclonic (anticyclonic) mesoscale eddies allowed constructing the mean three-dimensional eddy structure of the eastern South Pacific Ocean. Key differences in their thermohaline vertical structure were revealed. The core of cyclonic eddies {(CEs)} is centered at ∼150 m depth within the 25.2–26.0 kg m−3 potential density layer corresponding to the thermocline. In contrast, the core of the anticyclonic eddies {(AEs)} is located below the thermocline at ∼400 m depth impacting the 26.0–26.8 kg m−3 density layer. This difference was attributed to the mechanisms involved in the eddy formation. While intrathermocline {CEs} would be formed by instabilities of the surface equatorward coastal currents, the subthermocline {AEs} are likely to be shed by the subsurface poleward {Peru-Chile} Undercurrent. In the eddy core, maximum temperature and salinity anomalies are of {{\textpm}1{\textdegree}C} and {\textpm}0.1, with positive (negative) values for {AEs} {(CEs).} This study also provides new insight into the potential impact of mesoscale eddies for the cross-shore transport of heat and salt in the eastern South Pacific. Considering only the fraction of the water column associated with the fluid trapped within the eddies, each {CE} and {AE} has a typical volume anomaly flux of ∼0.1 Sv and yields to a heat and salt transport anomaly of {\textpm}1–3 {\texttimes} 1011 W and {\textpm}3–8 {\texttimes} 103 kg s−1, respectively.},

  abstract={There are two zonal bands of eminently high eddy kinetic energy {(EKE)} in the North Pacific Ocean. The highest one is located in the Kuroshio Extension and the second one is in the subtropical area. This paper focuses on the latter. An eddy detection scheme based on velocity vector geometry is applied to the {SSHA-derived} geostrophic currents to identify and track eddies, and to generate an eddy dataset which includes spatial and temporal information on eddy generation, evolution and termination. Analysis of this dataset allowed the investigation of a broad range of eddy parameters. From 1993 to 2010, about six thousand eddies with lifetime longer than eight weeks were generated within the band. All eddies moved westward, and both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies deflected northward south of {21{\textdegree}N} and southward north of {21{\textdegree}N,} respectively. Statistically, three different stages of an eddy's lifetime can be identified: the first one-fifth of its lifetime corresponds to the growing period; the successive three-fifths after that to its stable stage; the last one-fifth to its decaying period. Observed Argo vertical profiles collected within the detected eddy areas are used to investigate the eddy-induced vertical displacement of the thermocline and the halocline. Frontal intensity derived from the {SST} data is used to explain the mechanism modulating temporal and spatial eddy variations within the zonal band.},

Maps of mean zonal velocities at 1000 and 1500 m are presented. At both depths, a series of alternating westward and eastward zonal jets with a meridional scale of 1.5{\textdegree} is seen at the basin scale from {10{\textdegree}S} to {10{\textdegree}N.} These alternating jets, with mean speeds about 5 cm s−1, are clearly present in the western and central parts of the basin but weaken and disappear approaching the eastern coast. They are stronger in the Southern Hemisphere. Along the equator at both 1000 and 1500 m, a westward jet is seen. The jets closer to the equator are remarkably zonally coherent across the basin, but the jets farther poleward appear broken in several segments. In the western half of the basin, the 1000-m zonal jets appear to slant slightly poleward from east to west. At the western boundary in the south (east of Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea), the alternating jets appear to connect in narrow boundary currents. Seasonal zonal velocity anomalies at 1000 and 1500 m are observed to propagate westward across the basin; they are consistent with annual vertically propagating Rossby waves superimposed on the mean zonal jets. Their meridional structure suggests that more than one meridional mode is present.},

  journal={J Mar Res},
  abstract={The response of the deep equatorial ocean to an oscillatory baroclinic western boundary current is investigated in a continuously stratified primitive equation model. The symmetry of the current about the equator is such that mixed Rossby-gravity {(MRG)} waves are excited in the western part of the equatorial ocean. Depending on the forcing frequency, short to long scale (when compared to equatorial Rossby radius) monochromatic {MRG} waves are selected. The subsequent {MRG} wave destabilization generally leads to a much higher vertical mode response than the forced {MRG} wave {mode.In} a channel, short {MRG} waves are destabilized by shear instability {(Hua} et al., 2007). In a basin, the destabilization occurs in the vicinity of the western boundary and leads to the formation of finite amplitude, nonlinear jets in the entire equatorial basin. The space and time pattern of the jets correspond to low-frequency oscillating equatorial basin-modes, the period of which is set by the dominant vertical mode of the response. The vertical scale of the jets is a function mainly of the forcing period and is independent of the forcing vertical mode, as long as the excited {MRG} waves are in a sufficiently short regime to be {unstable.As} a result, an oscillatory western boundary current leads to a permanent equatorial zonal circulation, unlike a steady western boundary current. But most importantly, {MRG} wave destabilization appears to be a plausible formation mechanism for the observed Equatorial Deep Jets. The spatial and dynamical characteristics of the zonal circulation achieved with a 60-day forcing period are indeed compatible with the observations in the Atlantic Ocean.},

  journal={J Fluid Mech},
  abstract={The stability of mixed Rossby gravity {(MRG)} waves has been investigated numerically using three-dimensionally consistent high-resolution simulations of the continuously stratified primitive equations. For short enough zonal wavelength, the westward phase propagating {MRG} wave is strongly destabilized by barotropic shear instability leading to the formation of zonal jets. The large-scale instability of the zonally short wave generates zonal jets because it consists primarily of sheared meridional motions, as shown recently for the short barotropic Rossby wave problem. Simulations were done in a variety of domain geometries: a periodic re-entrant channel, a basin with a short {MRG} wave forced in its western part and a very long channel initialized with a zonally localized {MRG} wave. The characteristics of the zonal jets vary with the geometry. In the periodic re-entrant channel, barotropic zonal jets dominate the total flow response at the equator and its immediate vicinity. In the other cases, the destabilization leads to zonal jets with quite different characteristics, especially in the eastward group propagating part of the signal. The most striking result concerns the formation of zonal jets at the equator, alternating in sign in the vertical, with vertical scale short compared to the scale of the forcing or initial conditions. A stability analysis of a simplified perturbation vorticity equation is formulated to explain the spatial scale selection and growth rate of the zonal jets as functions of the characteristics of the basic state {MRG} wave. For both types of zonal jets, the model predicts that their meridional scales are comparable to the zonal scale of the {MRG} wave basic state, while their growth rates scale as μ ∝ Fr \{\textbar\}k\{\textbar\}, where Fr is the Froude number of the meridional velocity component of the basic state and k its non-dimensional zonal wavenumber. The vertical scale of the baroclinic zonal jets corresponds to the dominant harmonic ppeak of the basic state in the fastest growing mode, given by ppeak≈0.55k2. Thus, the shorter the zonal wavelength of the basic state {MRG} wave, the narrower the meridional scale of the zonal jets, both barotropic and baroclinic, with the vertical scale of the baroclinic jets being tied to their meridional scale through the equatorial radius of deformation, which decreases as the square root of the vertical wavenumber. The predictions of the spatial scales are in both qualitative and quantitative agreement with the numerical simulations, where shorter vertical scale baroclinic zonal jets are favoured by shorter-wavelength longer-period {MRG} wave basic states, with the vertical mode number increasing as the square of the {MRG} wave period. An Appendix deals with the case of zonally long and intermediate wavelength {MRG} waves, where a weak instability regime causes a moderate adjustment involving resonant triad interactions without leading to jet formation. For eastward phase propagating waves, adjustment does not lead to significant angular momentum redistribution.},

  issn={0022-3670},
  abstract={A complex pattern of zonal currents below the thermocline has been observed in the equatorial Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The currents have typical speeds from 10 to 15 cm s−1 and extend as deep as 2500 m. Their structure can be divided into two overlapping parts: the equatorial deep jets {(EDJs),} centered on the equator and alternating in the vertical with a wavelength of several hundred meters, and the Equatorial Intermediate Current system {(EICS),} composed of currents with large vertical scale and alternating with latitude over several degrees on either side of the equator. The strongest {EICS} current is a westward flow on the equator flanked by eastward currents at {2{\textdegree}N} and {2{\textdegree}S.} In the present study, the authors use idealized numerical simulations and analytical solutions to demonstrate that the {EICS} currents within 2.5{\textdegree} from the equator could result from the self-advection with dissipation of a downward-propagating beam of monthly periodic Yanai {(Rossby} gravity) waves. The zonally restricted beam is generated in the eastern part of the basin by instabilities of the swift near-surface equatorial currents. For a weak Yanai wave amplitude and no dissipation, mean Eulerian currents resembling the three strongest {EICS} currents are obtained but only within the beam; in this case, the Eulerian flow is balanced by the wave-induced Stokes drift, yielding a zero-mean Lagrangian flow, and the water parcels conserve their potential vorticity {(PV)} and are stationary over a wave cycle. For larger amplitudes, the Yanai waves break, losing their energy to small vertical scales where it is dissipated. This dissipation changes the mean (wave averaged) {PV} of a water parcel within the beam, allowing the parcel to have a persistent equatorward drift across {PV} contours. This can be viewed as a wave-induced Sverdrup transport; by continuity and by virtue of the westward group velocity of long Rossby waves, this Lagrangian-mean meridional flow requires a Lagrangian-mean zonal flow within and to the west of the beam, with a meridional structure consistent with the three strongest {EICS} currents. This mechanism of {EICS} formation is active in some ocean general circulation models; its importance in the ocean remains to be evaluated.},

  abstract={Eddy activity in the four major eastern boundary upwelling systems {(EBUS)} is investigated using 15years of satellite altimetry data. Based on the analysis of more than 4000 long-lived eddy trajectories in every {EBUS,} we show that mesoscale structures are mainly generated along the continental coasts and south of the main archipelagos and propagate westward with velocities increasing toward the equator. These mesoscale eddies, having radii of 70–160km, are then frequently observed along the coastal transition zones and frontal regions and some large oceanic areas are preferentially populated by cyclonic or anticyclonic eddies. Temporal variations of the number of newly-formed eddies and the associated eddy activity index, defined as the mean eddy energy density, are finally examined at seasonal and interannual scales. The strongest seasonal (interannual, respectively) variations are observed in the California {(Benguela)} upwelling systems. The proposed indices also exhibit contrasted long-term trends in each {EBUS,} which suggests that eddy activity might be sensitive to a warming climate.},

  abstract={This study investigates the distribution of the sea surface height anomaly {(SSHA)} with the aim of quantifying the characteristics of mesoscale eddies in the {Kuroshio–Oyashio} extension region {(KOER),} where intense mesoscale eddies are commonly observed during hydrographic surveys. Dense distributions of both anticyclonic eddies {(AEs)} and cyclonic eddies {(CEs)} are detected for the first time in {KOER} with sufficient temporal and spatial coverage, using the {Okubo–Weiss} parameter without smoothing. Their contribution to the total {SSHA} variance is estimated to be about 50\%. The zones of highest amplitudes are located north and south of the axis of the Kuroshio Extension {(KE)} for {AEs} and {CEs,} which represent warm-core and cold-core rings, respectively; the areas extend poleward along the Japan and {Kuril–Kamchatka} Trenches, especially for {AEs.} Eddies of both polarities and with moderate amplitudes are also recognized along the Subarctic Front {(SAF).} Eddies in areas north and south of the {KE} generally propagate westward, at a mean rate of 1–5 cm s−1; those along the trenches south of {46{\textdegree}N} and along the {SAF} propagate poleward at mean rates of 1–2 and 0.5–1 cm s−1, respectively. Because of the asymmetric distribution of the {AEs} and {CEs} in the areas north and south of the {KE,} and the asymmetric amplitude of them along the Japan and {Kuril–Kamchatka} Trenches, there exist significant eddy fluxes of vorticity, heat, and salinity in these areas.},

Many (\{\textgreater\}10,000) eddies are identified and followed in time using satellite altimetry observations and the spatial ocean color patterns surrounding each eddy are assessed. We find through a sequence of statistical hypothesis tests that not one but several mechanisms (i.e., eddy pumping, eddy advection and {eddy-Ekman} pumping) are responsible for the spatial-temporal ocean color patterns following individual eddies. Both eddy pumping and the {eddy-Ekman} pumping mechanisms alter subsurface nutrient distributions thereby driving biogeochemical cycles, while the eddy advection mechanism to first order stirs existing horizontal gradients in bio-optical properties. This work illustrates both the promise and some of the limitations of satellite observations for assessing the biogeochemical impacts of mesoscale eddies.},

The main goal of the paper is to assess what was learned from general circulation model (GCM) experiments over the recent two decades or so. Observational evidence regarding the nature of the interaction and dynamical theory of atmospheric anomalies forced by surface thermal anomalies is reviewed. Three types of GCM experiments used to address this problem are then examined: models with fixed climatological conditions and idealized, stationary SST anomalies; models with seasonally evolving climatology forced with realistic, time-varying SST anomalies; and models coupled to an interactive ocean. From representative recent studies, it is argued that the extratropical atmosphere does respond to changes in underlying SST although the response is small compared to internal (unforced) variability. Two types of interactions govern the response. One is an eddy-mediated process, in which a baroclinic response to thermal forcing induces and combines with changes in the position or strength of the storm tracks. This process can lead to an equivalent barotropic response that feeds back positively on the ocean mixed layer temperature. The other is a linear, thermodynamic interaction in which an equivalent-barotropic low-frequency atmospheric anomaly forces a change in SST and then experiences reduced surface thermal damping due to the SST adjustment. Both processes contribute to an increase in variance and persistence of low-frequency atmospheric anomalies and, in fact, may act together in the natural system.}},

This expansion has potentially important implications for subtropical societies and may lead to profound changes in the global climate system. Most importantly, poleward movement of large-scale atmospheric circulation systems, such as jet streams and storm tracks, could result in shifts in precipitation patterns affecting natural ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources. The implications of the expansion for stratospheric circulation and the distribution of ozone in the atmosphere are as yet poorly understood. The observed recent rate of expansion is greater than climate model projections of expansion over the twenty-first century, which suggests that there is still much to be learned about this aspect of global climate change.

A knowledge of SST mesoscale variability isimportant toward understanding the mesoscale air-sea interaction process in an upwelling zone. Almost-daily sea surface temperature data gathered by remote sensing techniques provided the basis for this investi-gation. These data were gathered over a period of 60 days during the COHO Project in summer 1973. In order to study the influence of wind forcing on the mesoscale SST field, wind data were gathered from ananemometer located at Newport, Ore. Some important results of this investigation are: 1) the daily SST fields respond rapidly to wind forcing;2) the three-week mean SST's tend to follow the large-scale bathymetry; and 3) identification of SST eddiesfrom day to day on daily perturbation (from the three-week means) maps is made difficult because of theexistence of strong horizontal flow and strong shear in the longshore current. Other important results are revealed by a two-dimensional spectral analysis of the daily horizontal sea surface temperature fields and theperturbation fields. This analysis indicates that a large amount of variance of the sea surface temperatureis concentrated in the 16-40 km wavelength range, and over the range of scales from 4-20 km the isotropicpart of the temperature variance spectrum obeys a 3 power law. These spectral results are importantbiologically and physically. An interesting feature of the mesoscale SST field, which is also important biologically and physically, is the existence of strong horizontal SST gradients called "oceanic fronts."}},

Eddies are characterized by large SST and SST gradient anomalies in all EBCS. At the end of the upwelling season, eddy‐induced SST gradients are dominant components of full SST gradients offshore of 300 km from the coast, especially in regions of high eddy activity. Comparisons between eddy‐induced and full SST gradients in the California Current System indicate that the offshore migration of mesoscale eddies plays a significant role on the seasonal widening of the region of high frontal activity. SST gradients associated with anticyclonic eddies are largest within 400 km from shore, while the signature of cyclones can extend for up to 700 km from the coast.

Results are also characterized by very low rates of detection of false positives. The latter is particularly important because eddies occupy only a small portion of the ocean map area. Experimental comparison is carried out using Laws' method for texture analysis. The results show that the proposed gradient‐based algorithm allows similar performances with a reduced design effort. The complexity of the proposed approach also compares favourably to other methods for identification of mesoscalar phenomena published in the literature. Given the satisfactory accuracy of the results obtained, the gradient‐based approach may be preferable to current techniques as it is simpler and more easily reconfigurable.}},

abstract = {{Abstract The coexistence in the deep ocean of a finite, stable stratification, a strong meridional overturning circulation, and mesoscale eddies raises complex questions concerning the circulation energetics. In particular, small-scale mixing processes are necessary to resupply the potential energy removed in the interior by the overturning and eddy-generating process. A number of lines of evidence, none complete, suggest that the oceanic general circulation, far from being a heat engine, is almost wholly governed by the forcing of the wind field and secondarily by deep water tides. In detail however, the budget of mechanical energy input into the ocean is poorly constrained. The now inescapable conclusion that over most of the ocean significant “vertical” mixing is confined to topographically complex boundary areas implies a potentially radically different interior circulation than is possible with uniform mixing. Whether ocean circulation models, either simple box or full numerical ones, neither explicitly accounting for the energy input into the system nor providing for spatial variability in the mixing, have any physical relevance under changed climate conditions is at issue.}},

  abstract={The Tasman Sea is unique - characterised by a strong seasonal western boundary current that breaks down into a complicated field of mesoscale eddies almost immediately after separating from the coast. Through a 16-year analysis of Tasman Sea eddies, we identify a region along the southeast Australian coast which we name {‘Eddy} Avenue’ where eddies have higher sea level anomalies, faster rotation and greater sea surface temperature and chlorophylla anomalies. The density of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies within Eddy Avenue is 23\% and 16\% higher respectively than the broader Tasman Sea. We find that Eddy Avenue cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies have more strongly differentiated biological properties than those of the broader Tasman Sea, as a result of larger anticyclonic eddies formed from Coral Sea water depressing chl. aconcentrations, and for coastal cyclonic eddies due to the entrainment of nutrient-rich shelf waters. Cyclonic eddies within Eddy Avenue have almost double the chlorophylla (0.35~mg m−3) of anticyclonic eddies (0.18~mg m−3). The average chlorophyll a concentration for cyclonic eddies is 16\% higher in Eddy Avenue and 28\% lower for anticyclonic eddies when compared to the Tasman Sea. With a strengthening East Australian Current, the propagation of these eddies will have significant implications for heat transport and the entrainment and connectivity of plankton and larval fish populations.},

  abstract={Large-scale features of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current {(ACC)} are described using all historical hydrographic data available from the Southern Ocean. The geopotential anomaly of the sea surface relative to 1000 db reveals the highly-sheared eastward flow of the {ACC} and the strong steering of the current by the ridge system around Antarctica. The near-surface property distributions differentiate the {ACC} waters from the warmer and saltier waters of the subtropical regimes. The Subtropical Front {(STF),} interrupted only by South America, marks the northern most extent of subantarctic waters. Distributions of properties on isopycnal surfaces show an abrupt end to the characteristic signal of the Upper Circumpolar Deep Water {(UCDW),} as this water mass shoals southward and is entrained into the surface mixed layer. This sharp water mass boundary nearly coincides with the southernmost circumpolar streamline passing through Drake Passage. To its south are the weakly-sheared circulations of the subpolar regime. Inspection of many hydrographic crossings of this transition reveals that the poleward edge of the {UCD} W signal is a reasonable definition of the southern boundary of the {ACC.} At Drake Passage, three deep-reaching fronts account for most of the {ACC} transport. Well-established indicators of the Subantarctic Front and Polar Front are traced unbroken around Antarctica. The third deep-reaching front observed to the south of the Polar Front at Drake Passage also continues with similar characteristics as a circumpolar feature. It is called here the southern {ACC} front. Stations from multiple synoptic transects of these circumpolar fronts are used to describe the average property structure within each {ACC} zone. Between the {STF} and the southern boundary of the {ACC,} the shear transport of the circumpolar current above 3000 m is at all longitudes about 100 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s−) eastward.},

  journal={Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans},
  abstract={This study undertakes a detailed comparison of different methods used for detecting and tracking oceanic jets in the Southern Ocean. The methods under consideration are the gradient thresholding method, the probability density function {(PDF)} method, and the contour method. Some weaknesses of the gradient thresholding method are discussed and an enhancement (the {WHOSE} method), based on techniques from signal processing, is proposed. The {WHOSE} method is then compared to the other three methods. Quantitative comparison is undertaken using synthetic sea-surface height fields. The {WHOSE} method and the contour method are found to perform well even in the presence of a strong eddy field. In contrast, the standard gradient thresholding and {PDF} methods only perform well in high signal-to-noise ratio situations. The {WHOSE,} {PDF,} and the contour methods are then applied to data from the eddy-resolving Ocean General Circulation Model for the Earth Simulator. While the three methods are in broad agreement on the location of the main {ACC} jets, the nature of the jet fields they produce differ. In particular, the {WHOSE} method reveals a fine-scale jet field with complex braiding behavior. It is argued that this fine-scale jet field may affect the calculation of eddy diffusivities. Finally, recommendations based on this study are made. The {WHOSE} and gradient thresholding methods are more suitable for the study of jets as localized strong currents, useful for studies of tracer fluxes. The contour and {PDF} methods are recommended for studies linking jets to hydrographic fronts.},

  journal={Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 1978 2012},
  abstract={The location of fronts has a direct influence on both the physical and biological processes in the Southern Ocean. Here we explore the relative importance of bottom topography and winds for the location of Southern Ocean fronts, using 100 years of a control and climate change simulation from the high resolution coupled climate model {HiGEM.} Topography has primary control on the number and intensity of fronts at each longitude. However, there is no strong relationship between the position or spacing of jets and underlying topographic gradients because of the effects of upstream and downstream topography. The Southern Hemisphere Westerlies intensify and shift south by 1.3{\textdegree} in the climate change simulation, but there is no comparable meridional displacement of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current's {(ACC)} path or the fronts within its boundaries, even over flat topography. Instead, the current contracts meridionally and weakens. North of the {ACC,} the Subtropical Front {(STF)} shifts south gradually, even over steep topographic ridges. We suggest the {STF} reacts more strongly to the wind shift because it is strongly surface intensified. In contrast, fronts within the {ACC} are more barotropic and are therefore more sensitive to the underlying topography. An assessment of different methods for identifying jets reveals that maxima of gradients in the sea surface height field are the most reliable. Approximating the position of fronts using sea surface temperature gradients is ineffective at high latitudes while using sea surface height contours can give misleading results when studying the temporal variability of front locations.},

  journal={Geophysical Research Letters},
  abstract={The frontal structure of the Southern Ocean is investigated using the {Wavelet/Higher} Order Statistics Enhancement {(WHOSE)} frontal detection method, introduced in Chapman’s work. This methodology is applied to 21 yr of daily gridded absolute dynamic topography {(ADT)} data to obtain daily maps of the locations of the fronts. By forming frontal occurrence frequency maps and then approximating these occurrence maps by a superposition of simple functions, the time-mean locations of the fronts, as well as a measure of their capacity to meander, are obtained and related to the frontal locations found by previous studies. The spatial and temporal variability of the frontal structure is then considered. The number of fronts is found to be highly variable throughout the Southern Ocean, increasing (splitting) downstream of large bathymetric features and decreasing (merging) in regions where the fronts are tightly controlled by the underlying topography. These splitting/merging events are related to changes in the underlying frontal structure whereby regions of high frontal occurrence cross or spread over streamfunction contours. In contrast to the number of fronts, frontal meandering remains relatively constant throughout the Southern Ocean. Little to no migration of the fronts over the 1993–2014 time period is found, and there is only weak sensitivity of frontal positions to atmospheric forcing related to the southern annular mode or the El {Ni{\~n}o–Southern} Oscillation. Finally, the implications of these results for the study of cross-stream tracer transport are discussed.},

The census includes 6.7 million eddies in daily data, which comprise 152,000 eddies tracked over their lifetimes, using a minimum lifetime cutoff of 28 days. Variables of interest include eddy diameter, thickness (vertical extent), minimum and maximum depth, location, rotational direction, lifetime, and translational speed. Distributions of these traits show a predominance of small, thin, short-lived, and slow eddies. Still, a significant number of eddies possess traits at the opposite extreme; thousands of eddies larger than 200 km in diameter appeared in daily data each year. A tracking algorithm found hundreds of eddies with lifetimes longer than 200 days. A third of the eddies are at least 1000 m tall and many penetrate the full depth of the water column. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current contains the thickest and highest density of eddies. Thick eddies are also common in the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio Current, and Agulhas ring pathway. The great majority of eddies extend all the way to the surface, confirming that eddy censuses from surface observations are a good proxy for the full-depth ocean. Correlations between variables show that larger-diameter eddies tend to be thicker and longer lived than small eddies.},

  title={{A}nalysis of {STCC} eddies using the {Okubo–Weiss} parameter on model and satellite data},
  journal={Ocean Dynamics},
  abstract={The North Pacific Subtropical Counter Current {(STCC)} is a weak zonal current comprising of a weak eastward flow near the surface (with speeds of less than 0.1~m/s and a thickness of approximately 50–100~m) and westward flow (the North Equatorial Current) beneath. Previous studies (e.g., Qiu Geophysical Research Letters 29: 2471–2486, 1999) have shown that the {STCC} is baroclinically unstable. Therefore, despite its weak mean speeds, nonlinear {STCC} eddies with diameters \{\textasciitilde\}300~km or larger and rotational speeds exceeding the eddy propagation speeds develop {(Samelson} Geophysical Research Letters 27: 2645–2662, 1997; Chelton et al. Prog Oceanogr 91: 167–216, 2011). In this study, the authors present numerical experiments to describe and explain the instability and eddy-generation processes of the {STCC} and the seasonal variation. Emphasis is on finite-amplitude eddies which are analyzed based on the parameter of Okubo {(Deep-Sea} Res 17: 445–454, 1970) and Weiss {(Physica} D 48: 273–294, 1991). The temperature and salinity distribution in March and April offer the favorable condition for eddies to grow, while September and October are unfavorable seasons for the generation of eddies. {STCC} is maintained not only by subsurface front but also by the sea surface temperature {(SST)} front. The seasonal variation of the vertical shear is dominated by the seasonal surface {STCC} velocity. The {SST} front enhances the instability and lead to the faster growth of {STCC} eddies in winter and spring. The near-surface processes are therefore crucial for the {STCC} system.},

  abstract={We examine the seasonal cycle of upper-ocean mesoscale turbulence in a high resolution {CESM} climate simulation. The ocean model component {(POP)} has 0.1{\textdegree} resolution, mesoscale resolving at low and middle latitudes. Seasonally and regionally resolved wavenumber power spectra are calculated for sea-surface eddy kinetic energy {(EKE).} Although the interpretation of the spectral slopes in terms of turbulence theory is complicated by the strong presence of dissipation and the narrow inertial range, the {EKE} spectra consistently show higher power at small scales during winter throughout the ocean. Potential hypotheses for this seasonality are investigated. Diagnostics of baroclinc energy conversion rates and evidence from linear quasigeostrophic stability analysis indicate that seasonally varying mixed-layer instability is responsible for the seasonality in {EKE.} The ability of this climate model, which is not considered submesoscale resolving, to produce mixed layer instability although damped by dissipation, demonstrates the ubiquity and robustness of this process for modulating upper ocean {EKE.}},

  abstract={The overturning circulation of the global oceans is examined from an energetics viewpoint. A general framework for stratified turbulence is used for this purpose; first, it highlights the importance of available potential energy in facilitating the transfer of kinetic energy to the background potential energy (defined as the adiabatically rearranged state with no motion). Next, it is shown that it is the rate of transfer between different energy reservoirs that is important for the maintenance of the ocean overturning, rather than the total amount of potential or kinetic energy. A series of numerical experiments is used to assess which energy transfers are significant in the overturning circulation. In the steady state, the rate of irreversible diapycnal mixing is necessarily balanced by the production of available potential energy sourced from surface buoyancy fluxes. Thus, the external inputs of available potential energy from surface buoyancy forcing and of kinetic energy from other sources (such as surface winds and tides, and leading to turbulent mixing) are both necessary to maintain the overturning circulation.},

  abstract={In order to make the scientific meaning of the word ‘turbulence’ clear, it is proposed that a fluid be called turbulent if each component of the vorticity is distributed irregularly and aperiodically in time and space, if the flow is characterized by a transfer of energy from larger to smaller scales of motion, and if the mean separation of neighboring fluid particles tends to increase with time. Whether or not a flow is turbulent is not simply a matter of Reynolds number, since the stability of the flow is a criterion of at least equal importance. From the results of experimental work in recent years of a number of people {(Anderson,} Frenkiel and Katz, Kellogg, Liller and Whipple, Malkus) it seems reasonable to infer that, with the exception of strong inversion layers, the atmosphere may be assumed to be turbulent everywhere, although the intensity of the turbulence varies widely in both time and space. If the Kolmogoroff similarity theory of locally isotropic turbulence is accepted, the most important parameter in the turbulent field is the energy dissipation ε.},

  abstract={Sea surface slopes from the altimetric satellites Geosat and {TOPEX/POSEIDON} are used to calculate eddy kinetic energy of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre {(40–65{\textdegree}N,} {60{\textdegree}–5{\textdegree}W).} Using two years of data from each satellite {(December} 1986 to December 1988 and October 1992 to September 1994, respectively), interannual differences in the North Atlantic Current {(NAC)} are revealed. In regions of strong currents the eddies are driven by baroclinic instability of the mean flow, are not seasonally varying, and may therefore be used as a surrogate for the mean flow itself. Wind stress curl fields for the same periods show that the northward and southward shifts in the current branches across the {Mid-Atlantic} Ridge are related to interannual differences in the winter wind stress curl pattern when the zero in wind stress curl is well defined and wind stress is at a maximum. Outside the {NAC,} the eddies are driven primarily by wind stress, indicated by a significant seasonality. Time series of eddy kinetic energy and wind stress are generated for the 4 years, and the magnitude, phase, and significance of annual and semiannual signals are determined. Interannual changes in the timing of the maximum eddy kinetic energy are associated with that of the maximum wind stress, with each being shifted by a month or two later or earlier. Throughout much of the northern North Atlantic a significant annual signal in eddy kinetic energy is observed, lagging the wind stress by, on average, 6 weeks. A negligible lag is found in the region of the East Greenland Current and Irminger Sea, whereas the greatest lag, about 2 months, is found in the Labrador Sea.},

  abstract={The response of eddy kinetic energy {(EKE)} to the strengthening of Southern Hemisphere winds occurring since the 1950s is investigated with a global ocean model having a resolution of 1/12{\textdegree} in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current domain. The simulations expose regional differences in the relative importance of stochastic and wind-related contributions to interannual {EKE} changes. In the Pacific and Indian sectors the model captures the {EKE} variability observed since 1993 and confirms previous hypotheses of a lagged response to regional wind stress anomalies. Here the multidecadal trend in wind stress is reflected in an increase in {EKE} typically exceeding 5 cm2 s−2 decade−1. In the western Atlantic, {EKE} variability is mostly stochastic, is weakly correlated with wind fluctuations, and its multidecadal trends are close to zero. The nonuniform distribution of wind-related changes in the eddy activity could affect the regional patterns of ocean circulation and biogeochemical responses to future climate change.},

An updated analysis of the Southern Ocean satellite altimetry record indicates an increase in eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in recent decades, contemporaneous with a probable decrease in ACC transport. The EKE trend is largest in the Pacific (14.9âÂ±â4.1 cm2 sâ2 per decade) and Indian (18.3âÂ±â5.1 cm2 sâ2 per decade) sectors of the Southern Ocean. We test the hypothesis that variations in wind stress can account for the observed EKE trends using perturbation experiments conducted with idealized high-resolution ocean models. The decadal increase in EKE is most likely due to continuing increases in the wind stress over the Southern Ocean, albeit with considerable interannual variability superposed. ACC transport correlates well with wind stress on these interannual time scales, but is weakly affected by wind forcing at longer periods. The increasing intensity of the Southern Ocean eddy field has implications for overturning circulation, carbon cycling, and climate.},

	abstract={Mesoscale eddies play a major role in the transport of tracers in the ocean. Focusing on a sector in the east Pacific, the authors present estimates of eddy diffusivities derived from kinematic tracer simulations using satellite-observed velocity fields. Meridional diffusivities are diagnosed, and how they are related to eddy properties through the mixing length formulation of Ferrari and Nikurashin, which accounts for the suppression of diffusivity due to eddy propagation relative to the mean flow, is shown. The uniqueness of this study is that, through systematically varying the zonal-mean flow, a hypothetical “unsuppressed” diffusivity is diagnosed. At a given latitude, the unsuppressed diffusivity occurs when the zonal-mean flow equals the eddy phase speed. This provides an independent estimate of eddy phase propagation, which agrees well with theoretical arguments. It is also shown that the unsuppressed diffusivity is predicted very well by classical mixing length theory, that is, that it is proportional to the rms eddy velocity times the observed eddy size, with a spatially constant mixing efficiency of 0.35. Then, the suppression factor is estimated and it is shown that it too can be understood quantitatively in terms of easily observed mean flow properties. The authors then extrapolate from these sector experiments to the global scale, making predictions for the global surface eddy diffusivity. Together with a prognostic equation for eddy kinetic energy and a theory explaining observed eddy sizes, these concepts could potentially be used in a closure for eddy diffusivities in coarse-resolution ocean climate models.},

Compared with reanalysis climatologies there is an equatorward bias of 3.3{\textdegree} (inter-model standard deviation of {\textpm} 1.9{\textdegree}) in the ensemble mean position of the zonal mean jet. The ensemble mean strength is biased slightly too weak, with the largest biases over the Pacific sector (−1.4 {\textpm} 1.2 m/s, −19\%). An analysis of atmosphere-only {(AMIP)} experiments indicates that 28\% of the zonal mean position bias comes from coupling of the ocean/ice models to the atmosphere. The response to future emissions scenarios {(RCP4.5} and {RCP8.5)} is characterized by two phases: (i) the period of most rapid ozone recovery (2000–2049) during which there is insignificant change in summer; and (ii) the period 2050–2098 during which {RCP4.5} simulations show no significant change but {RCP8.5} simulations show poleward shifts (0.33, 0.18 and 0.27{\textdegree}/decade over the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific sectors, respectively), and increases in strength (0.07, 0.08 and 0.15 m/s/decade, respectively). The models with larger equatorward position biases generally show larger poleward shifts (i.e. state dependence). This inter-model relationship is strongest over the Pacific sector (r = −0.91) and weakest over the Atlantic sector (r = −0.39). An assessment of jet structure shows that over the Atlantic sector jet shift is not clearly linked to indices of jet structure whereas over the Pacific sector the distance between the sub-polar and sub-tropical westerly jets appears to be important.},

We present an analysis of the acute sensitivity of the identification results to varying the methodâs free parameters, and develop physically justified parameter choices that allow for systematic vortex identification. In contrast to prior vortex studies, we probe the broad spectrum of coherency in the ocean by determining free parameter choices that partition the spectrum into distinct coherency classes , allowing for the identification of strictly coherent, moderately coherent, and leaky vortices. Our tuning methodology is grounded in a combination of sensitivity analysis, convergence tests, and consideration of the ocean modelâs physics. To aid in this process, we introduce the Coherency Index , a novel Lagrangian diagnostic for mathematically quantifying the degree of material coherency of a Lagrangian vortex. We aim for this manuscript and the accompanying open-access code to serve as a manual and toolset for the oceanographer interested in harnessing a rigorous Lagrangian method to uncover coherent structures in ocean models and observations.},

The {FTLE} fields reveal with unprecedented detail an intricate tangle of {LCSs,} which are hidden in ocean surface topography maps but sometimes are apparent in ocean color images. These {LCSs} delineate fluid domains with very different advective properties, and thus their detection provides an objective (i.e., frame-independent) means of identifying eddy boundaries. The importance of considering {LCSs} in quantifying transport by eddies is highlighted. Such a quantification does not rely on the common assumptionâwhich is shown to be generally not validâthat transport is largely effected by the trapping and subsequent translation of water slugs inside eddies defined as the regions enclosed by sea height (streamfunction) contours within which rotation dominates over strain. {LCSs} are calculated for the whole globe and compared with satellite-tracked drogue drifter trajectories within a selected region of the South Atlantic.},

	abstract={Interannual variations in Southern Ocean eddy kinetic energy {(EKE)} are investigated using 16 years of altimetric data. Circumpolar averages show a peak in {EKE} from 2000 to 2002, 2â3 years after the peak in the Southern Annular Mode {(SAM)} index. Although the {SAM} forcing is in phase around the circumpolar band, we find the {EKE} response varies regionally. The strongest {EKE} is in the Pacific, with energy peaks occurring progressively later toward the east. We suggest that this is due to the presence of two climate modes: {SAM} and {ENSO.} When strong positive {SAM} events coincide with La Ni{\~n}a periods, as in 1999, anomalous meridional wind forcing is enhanced in the South Pacific Ocean, contributing to the observed increase in {EKE} 2â3 years later. When positive {SAM} events coincide with El Ni{\~n}o periods, as in 1993, the climate modes are in opposition in the South Pacific, leading to a weak {EKE} response during the mid-1990s. Numerical modeling supports these observations. By applying different combinations of {SAM} and {ENSO,} we can reproduce both the elevated Pacific {EKE} response to {SAM} as well as an additional amplification/suppression of {EKE} during La {Ni{\~n}a/El} Ni{\~n}o. In general, we find that the {EKE} response depends on the interplay between wind forcing, topography, and mean flow and produces a strongly heterogeneous distribution in the Southern Ocean.},

Analysis of the ocean heat budget reveals that mesoscale eddies act to transport heat upward in a manner that partially compensates (or offsets) for the downward heat transport from the time-mean currents. Stronger vertical eddy heat transport in {CM2.6} relative to {CM2.5} accounts for the significantly smaller temperature drift in {CM2.6.} The mesoscale eddy parameterization used in {CM2-1deg} also imparts an upward heat transport, yet it differs systematically from that found in {CM2.6.} This analysis points to the fundamental role that ocean mesoscale features play in transient ocean heat uptake. In general, the more accurate simulation found in {CM2.6} provides an argument for either including a rich representation of the ocean mesoscale in model simulations of the mean and transient climate or for employing parameterizations that faithfully reflect the role of eddies in both lateral and vertical heat transport.},

	abstract={Mesoscale processes play fundamental roles in the dynamics and biogeochemistry of the Southern Ocean. Previous modeling studies with coarse resolution models show varying estimates of carbon uptake there due to the differences in the representation of physical circulation and mesoscale processes. We develop a new eddy-permitting carbon cycle model of the Southern Ocean with improved representation of eddies, jets, and frontal structures. The model employs physical circulation fields from a Southern Ocean State Estimate: a model solution that is constrained by a suite of remotely sensed and in situ measurements to ensure realistic hydrographic structures and transport fields. A simple biogeochemistry model is coupled to the physical model to simulate the cycling of alkalinity, carbon, and nutrients. In this paper we compare simulated biogeochemical tracers with observations, and diagnose mechanisms controlling the regional carbon cycle. Model-data comparisons in Drake Passage and {CLIVAR} repeat sections provide tests for the model performance in capturing observed biogeochemical properties. Temporal variability of air-sea {CO2} flux is primarily controlled by surface {pCO2} on seasonal timescale, modulated by rapid fluctuations in surface wind speed on a shorter timescale. Analysis of simulated carbon transport indicates that the zonal mean circulation transports carbon southward, partly compensated by the northward stationary and transient eddy fluxes. Variability of zonal mean circulation, which is strongly correlated with Ekman transport, dominates the temporal variability of meridional carbon transport across the Polar Front.},

	abstract={Owing to the turbulent nature of the ocean, mesoscale eddies are omnipresent. The impact of these transitory and approximately circular sea surface temperature fronts on the overlying atmosphere is not well known. Stationary fronts such as the Gulf Stream have been reported to lead to pronounced atmospheric changes1,2. However, the impact of transient ocean eddies on the atmosphere has not been determined systematically, except on winds and to some extent clouds3,4,5,6. Here, we examine the atmospheric conditions associated with over 600,000 individual eddies in the Southern Ocean, using satellite data. We show that ocean eddies locally affect near-surface wind, cloud properties and rainfall. The observed pattern of atmospheric change is consistent with a mechanism in which sea surface temperature anomalies associated with the oceanic eddies modify turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer. In the case of cyclonic eddies, this modification triggers a slackening of near-surface winds, a decline in cloud fraction and water content, and a reduction in rainfall. We conclude that transient mesoscale ocean structures can significantly affect much larger atmospheric low-pressure systems that swiftly pass by at the latitudes investigated.},

	abstract={Eddy saturation refers to a regime in which the total volume transport of an oceanic current is insensitive to the wind stress strength. Baroclinicity is currently believed to be key to the development of an eddy-saturated state. In this paper, it is shown that eddy saturation can also occur in a purely barotropic flow over topography, without baroclinicity. Thus, eddy saturation is a fundamental property of barotropic dynamics above topography. It is demonstrated that the main factor controlling the appearance or not of eddysaturated states in the barotropic setting is the structure of geostrophic contours, that is the contours of f {/H} of the ratio of the Coriolis parameter to the oceanâs depth. Eddy-saturated states occur when the geostrophic contours are open, that is when the geostrophic contours span the whole zonal extent of the domain. This minimal requirement for eddy-saturated states is demonstrated using numerical integrations of a single-layer quasi-geostrophic flow over two different topographies characterized by either open or closed geostrophic contours with parameter values loosely inspired by the Southern Ocean. In this setting, transient eddies are produced through a barotropicâtopographic instability that occurs due tot the interaction of the large-scale zonal flow with the topography. By studying this barotropicâtopographic instability insight is gained on how eddy-saturated states are established.},

Here we use regional simulations with a coupled high-resolution atmosphereâocean model of the South Atlantic, to show that mesoscale ocean features and, in particular, eddies can be energized by their thermodynamic interactions with the atmosphere. Owing to their sea-surface temperature anomalies affecting the wind field above them, the oceanic eddies in the presence of a large-scale wind gradient provide a mesoscale conduit for the transfer of energy into the ocean. Our simulations show that this pathway is responsible for up to 10\% of the kinetic energy of the oceanic mesoscale eddy field in the South Atlantic. The conditions for this pathway to inject energy directly into the mesoscale prevail over much of the Southern Ocean north of the Polar Front.},

Its spaceâtime variability modulates water mass formation and carbon sequestration processes related to both the physical and biological pumps. These processes are particularly relevant in the Southern Ocean, where surface mixedâlayer depth estimates are generally obtained either as climatological fields derived from in situ observations or through numerical simulations. Here we demonstrate that weekly observationâbased reconstructions can be used to describe the variations of the mixedâlayer depth in the upper ocean over a range of space and time scales. We compare and validate four different products obtained by combining satellite measurements of the sea surface temperature, salinity, and dynamic topography and in situ Argo profiles. We also compute an ensemble mean and use the corresponding spread to estimate mixedâlayer depth uncertainties and to identify the more reliable products. The analysis points out the advantage of synergistic approaches that include in input the sea surface salinity observations obtained through a multivariate optimal interpolation. Corresponding data allow to assess mixedâlayer depth seasonal and interannual variability. Specifically, the maximum correlations between mixedâlayer anomalies and the Southern Annular Mode are found at different time lags, related to distinct summer/winter responses in the Antarctic Intermediate Water and {SubâAntarctic} Mode Waters main formation areas. The Southern Ocean mixedâlayer depth seasonal and interannual variability is retrieved from different observationâbased {3âD} reconstructions Synergistic techniques that ingest sea surface salinity obtained through multivariate interpolation provide the most accurate estimates The nonzonal response of the mixedâlayer anomalies to the Southern Annual Mode is related to distinct seasonal patterns},

	abstract={ We present a new surface-atmospheric dataset for driving ocean~-~sea-ice models based on Japanese 55-year atmospheric reanalysis {(JRA-55),} referred to here as {JRA55-do.} The {JRA55-do} dataset aims to replace the {CORE} interannual forcing version 2 (hereafter called the {CORE} dataset), which is currently used in the framework of the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments {(COREs)} and the Ocean Model Intercomparison Project {(OMIP).} A major improvement in {JRA55-do} is the refined horizontal grid spacing (â¯âŒâ¯55km) and temporal interval (3hr). The data production method for {JRA55-do} essentially follows that of the {CORE} dataset, whereby the surface fields from an atmospheric reanalysis are adjusted relative to reference datasets. To improve the adjustment method, we use high-quality products derived from satellites and from several other atmospheric reanalysis projects, as well as feedback on the {CORE} dataset from the ocean modelling community. Notably, the surface air temperature and specific humidity are adjusted using multi-reanalysis ensemble means. In {JRA55-do,} the downwelling radiative fluxes and precipitation, which are affected by an ambiguous cloud parameterisation employed in the atmospheric model used for the reanalysis, are based on the reanalysis products. This approach represents a notable change from the {CORE} dataset, which imported independent observational products. Consequently, the {JRA55-do} dataset is more self-contained than the {CORE} dataset, and thus can be continually updated in near real-time. The {JRA55-do} dataset extends from 1958 to the present, with updates expected at least annually. This paper details the adjustments to the original {JRA-55} fields, the scientific rationale for these adjustments, and the evaluation of {JRA55-do.} The adjustments successfully corrected the biases in the original {JRA-55} fields. The globally averaged features are similar between the {JRA55-do} and {CORE} datasets, implying that {JRA55-do} can suitably replace the {CORE} dataset for use in driving global ocean~-~sea-ice models.},

	abstract={The meridional Ekman transport in a zonally reentrant channel may be balanced by diabatic circulations, standing eddies associated with topography, or by Lagrangian mean eddy mass fluxes. A simple model is used to explore the interaction between these mechanisms. A key assumption of this study is that diabatic forcing in the poleward edge of the channel acts to create lighter fluid, as is the case with net freshwater fluxes into the Southern Ocean. For weak wind forcing or strong diabatic constraint, a simple scaling argument accurately predicts the level of baroclinic shear. However, given our understanding of the relative magnitudes of Ekman flux and deep upwelling, this is not the appropriate parameter range for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. With stronger wind stresses, eddies are prominent, with baroclinic instability initially developing in the vicinity of large topography. Arguments have been advanced by a number of authors that baroclinic instability should limit the velocity shear, leading to a stiff upper limit on the transport of the current. However, in the simulations presented here baroclinic instability is largely confined to the region of topographic highs, and the approach to a current that is independent of the wind stress occurs gradually. Several recent parameterizations of transient eddy fluxes do not reproduce key features of the observed behavior.},

These new atlases are compared with previously published 5{\textdegree} {\texttimes} 5{\textdegree} coarse resolution maps of Î»1 for the Northern Hemisphere and the South Atlantic and with a 1{\textdegree} {\texttimes} 1{\textdegree} fine-resolution map of c1 for the tropical Pacific. It is concluded that the methods used in these earlier estimates yield values that are biased systematically low by 5\%â15\% owing to seemingly minor computational errors. Geographical variations in the new high-resolution maps of c1 and Î»1 are discussed in terms of a {WKB} approximation that elucidates the effects of earth rotation, stratification, and water depth on these quantities. It is shown that the effects of temporal variations of the stratification can be neglected in the estimation of c1 and Î»1 at any particular location in the World Ocean. This is rationalized from consideration of the {WKB} approximation.},

	abstract={It has been suggested that a strengthening of the Southern Hemisphere winds would induce a more vigorous overturning through an increased northward Ekman flux, bringing more light waters into the oceanic basins and enhancing the upwelling of North Atlantic Deep Water in the Southern Ocean, thereby increasing ocean ventilation. Simulations from a coarse- and a fine-resolution version of a coupled model, subject to idealized wind stress changes in the Southern Ocean, are presented. In the fine-resolution eddy-permitting model, changes in poleward eddy fluxes largely compensate for the enhanced equatorward Ekman transport in the Southern Ocean. As a consequence, northward transport of light waters, pycnocline depth, Northern Hemisphere overturning, and Southern Ocean upwelling anomalies are much reduced compared with simulations in the coarse-resolution model with parameterized eddies. These results suggest a relatively weak sensitivity of present-day global ocean overturning circulation to the projected strengthening of the Southern Hemisphere winds.},

The response of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the carbon sink in the Southern Ocean to changes in wind stress and surface buoyancy fluxes is under debate. Here we analyse the Argo network of profiling floats and historical oceanographic data to detect coherent hemispheric-scale warming and freshening trends that extend to depths of more than 1,000 m. The warming and freshening is partly related to changes in the properties of the water masses that make up the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which are consistent with the anthropogenic changes in heat and freshwater fluxes suggested by climate models. However, we detect no increase in the tilt of the surfaces of equal density across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, in contrast to coarse-resolution model studies.

The model explains both the insensitivity of circumpolar volume transport to surface wind stress and the increase of eddy energy with wind stress. The model further predicts that circumpolar transport increases with increased bottom friction, a counterintuitive result that is confirmed in eddy-permitting calculations.

It is demonstrated that this variability is dependent upon the explicit simulation of the dynamics of mesoscale eddies. As such, the variability is sensitive to stratification, horizontal viscosity, bottom stress, and topography. The energetic balance of the variability is diagnosed, and a driving mechanism is proposed that involves positive feedback between the generation of eddies through baroclinic instability and the dynamics of the mean circulation.},

The extended 1000 m depth range available from the 38 {kHz} {ADCP} allows us to investigate the vertical structure of the current. The mean observed current varies slowly with depth, while eddy kinetic energy and shear variance exhibit strong depth dependence. Objectively mapped streamlines are self-similar with depth, consistent with an equivalent barotropic structure. Vertical wavenumber spectra of observed currents and current shear reveal intermediate wavenumber anisotropy and rotation indicative of downward energy propagation above 500 m and upward propagation below 500 m. The mean observed transport of the {ACC} in the upper 1000 m is estimated at 95 {\textpm} 2 Sv or 71\% of the canonical total transport of 134 Sv. Mean current speeds in the {ACC} jets remain quite strong at 1000 m, 10â20 cm sâ1.

At sufficiently high resolution, there is little or no sensitivity of circumpolar transport to wind stress, even in the limit of no wind. In contrast, the meridional overturning circulation continues to vary with Southern Ocean wind stress, but with reduced sensitivity in the limit of high wind stress. Both the circumpolar transport and meridional overturning continue to vary with diapycnal diffusivity at all model resolutions. The circumpolar transport becomes less sensitive to changes in diapycnal diffusivity at higher resolution, although sensitivity always remains.

Fundamental to reconciling these diverse views is to understand properly the role of eddies in counteracting the directly wind-forced changes in overturning. Here, the authors use novel theoretical considerations and fine-resolution ocean models to develop a new scaling for the sensitivity of eddy-induced mixing to changes in winds, and they demonstrate that changes in Southern Ocean overturning in response to recent and future changes in wind stress forcing are likely to be substantial, even in the presence of a decadally varying eddy field.

The authors find that the total transport across the {PF} core results from a ubiquitous Ekman transport that drives the upwelled tracers to the north and a localized opposing eddy transport that induces tracer leakages to the south at major topographic obstacles. In the Ekman layer, the southward eddy transport only partially compensates the northward Ekman transport, while below the Ekman layer, the southward eddy transport dominates the total transport but remains much smaller in magnitude than the near-surface northward transport. Most of the southward branch of the total transport is achieved below the {PF} core, mainly through geostrophic currents. This study finds that the eddy-diffusive transport reinforces the southward eddy-advective transport for carbon and heat, and opposes it for oxygen and phosphate. Eddy-advective transport is likely to be the leading-order component of eddy-induced transport for all four tracers. However, eddy-diffusive transport may provide a significant contribution to the southward eddy heat transport due to strong along-isopycnal temperature gradients.},

However, the exact pathways and role of topography in Southern Ocean upwelling remain largely unknown. Here we show detailed upwelling pathways in three dimensions, using hydrographic observations and particle tracking in high-resolution models. The analysis reveals that the northern-sourced deep waters enter the Antarctic Circumpolar Current via southward flow along the boundaries of the three ocean basins, before spiraling southeastward and upward through the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Upwelling is greatly enhanced at five major topographic features, associated with vigorous mesoscale eddy activity. Deep water reaches the upper ocean predominantly south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, with a spatially nonuniform distribution.

This distribution is confirmed by high-resolution numerical modeling output as well. Most of these eddies are 5\{\textasciitilde\}20 km in radius, less than the local first baroclinic deformation radius, thus categorized as submesoscale.

The budget analysis of eddy kinetic energy shows that both the horizontal shear and vertical buoyancy flux are important energy sources for eddy generation on the two sides of Kuroshio axis.

	abstract={The circumpolar transport of a wind-driven quasigeostrophic Antarctic Circumpolar Current is considered. Simple theory suggests transport in a strongly forced regimeâthe focus of this studyâis largely determined by a partitioning of the southward Sverdrup flux into Drake Passage latitudes: some streamlines feed a âbasin contributionâ to the circumpolar transport and others feed a large-scale recirculation gyre. Simulations assuming an idealized Scotia Ridge topography are considered to test for sensitivity to resolution. Considerable sensitivity to both vertical and horizontal resolution is found, and associated with this is a tight stationary eddy trapped on the western flank of the ridge. That is, this eddy is sensitive to resolution and exerts an influence that acts to reduce the circumpolar transport. Simulations using the Scotia Ridgeâlike topography are also compared to others using more realistic topography. In the idealized (ridge) topography experiments, there is only a single ridge against which topographic form drag can act to remove eastward momentum from the system; in the complex topography experiments, there are many. It is found that the experiments assuming realistic topography do not develop an analog to the single topographically trapped eddy prevalent in the Scotia Ridge topography simulations. Additionally, circumpolar transport in these simulations agrees better with the theory. Whether this agreement is simply fortuitous, however, is unclear. To address this, a series of simulations assumes topography that varies smoothly between the idealized ridge and realistic configurations.},

	abstract = { AbstractEddy-permitting simulations of a wind-driven quasigeostrophic model in an idealized Southern Ocean setting are used to attempt to describe what sets the wind-driven circumpolar transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). For weak forcing, the transport is well described as a linear sum of channel and basin components. The authorsâ main focus is on stronger forcing. In this regime, an eddy-driven recirculation appears in the abyssal layer, and all time-mean circumpolar streamlines are found to stem from a Sverdrup-like interior. The Sverdrup flux into Drake Passage latitudes can then be thought of as the sum of one part that feeds the circumpolar current and another that is associated with the recirculation. The relative fractions of this partitioning depend on the bottom drag, the midchannel wind stress, and the wind stress curl. Increasing the strength of the bottom drag reduces the recirculation and increases circumpolar transport. Increasing a zero-curl eastward wind stress reduces the upper-layer expression of the recirculation and increases the transport. Increasing the curl-containing portion of the forcing (while holding the midchannel stress constant) increases the recirculation and decreases the transport.The weakly forced regime is also considered, as are the relative roles of large and small-scale eddies in transporting momentum vertically through the water column in the Drake Passage latitude band. It is found that the vertical momentum flux associated with transient structures can be used to distinguish between different regimes: these structures transmit momentum upward when the dynamics is dominated by the large-scale recirculation gyre and downward when it is not. }

	abstract={Recent studies highlight that oceanic motions associated with horizontal scales smaller than 50 km, defined here as submesoscales, lead to anomalous vertical heat fluxes from colder to warmer waters. This unique~transport property is not captured in climate models that have insufficient resolution to simulate these submesoscale dynamics. Here, we use an ocean model with an unprecedented resolution that, for the first time, globally resolves submesoscale heat transport. Upper-ocean submesoscale turbulence produces a systematically-upward heat transport that is five times larger than mesoscale heat transport, with winter-time averages up to 100 W/m2 for mid-latitudes. Compared to a lower-resolution model, submesoscale heat transport warms the sea surface up to 0.3 {{\textdegree}C} and produces an upward annual-mean air–sea heat flux anomaly of 4–10 W/m2 at mid-latitudes. These results indicate that submesoscale dynamics are critical to the transport of heat between the ocean interior and the atmosphere, and are thus a key component of the Earth’s climate. Oceanic motions associated with horizontal scales smaller than 50 km remain unresolved in climate models. Here the authors show that motions in this scale range are critical to the global transport of heat between the ocean interior and the atmosphere, and are thus a key component of the Earth’s climate.},

Specifically, the wind stress is taken to be a quadratic function of Ua − uo, where Ua and uo are the 10-m wind and ocean surface velocity, respectively. Because {\{\textbar\}Ua\{\textbar\}} is typically large relative to \{\textbar\}uo\{\textbar\}, accounting for a uo dependence leads only to relatively small changes in τ. The change to the basin-averaged wind power source, however, is considerably larger. Scaling arguments and quasigeostrophic simulations in a basin setting are presented.

In particular, we test the suggestion that accounting for ocean currents in the calculation of stress from 10 m winds can result in a reduction of 20–35\% in the wind work, compared with an approximate calculation in which currents are not accounted for. We calculate the predicted effect of accounting for ocean currents to be a reduction in power of about 0.19 {TW,} and find a total power input from observations which include this effect to be 0.76 {TW,} smaller than earlier estimates by about the right amount. By recalculating the power input using smoothed wind stresses or currents, we demonstrate that the effect of ocean currents is visible in the midlatitude data, and close to the predicted value. Proof that the data are adequate to resolve the effect in the tropics, however, is lacking, suggesting that additional processes may also be important in this region.},

	abstract={Mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous features in the Southern Ocean, yet their phenomenology is not well quantified. To tackle this task, we use satellite observations of sea level anomalies and sea surface temperature {(SST)} as well as in situ temperature and salinity measurements from profiling floats. Over the period 1997–2010, we identified over a million mesoscale eddy instances and were able to track about 105 of them over 1 month or more. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current {(ACC),} the boundary current systems, and the regions where they interact are hot spots of eddy presence, representing also the birth places and graveyards of most eddies. These hot spots contrast strongly to areas shallower than about 2000 m, where mesoscale eddies are essentially absent, likely due to topographical steering. Anticyclones tend to dominate the southern subtropical gyres, and cyclones the northern flank of the {ACC.} Major causes of regional polarity dominance are larger formation numbers and lifespans, with a contribution of differential propagation pathways of long‐lived eddies. Areas of dominance of one polarity are generally congruent with the same polarity being longer‐lived, bigger, of larger amplitude, and more intense. Eddies extend down to at least 2000 m. In the {ACC,} eddies show near surface temperature and salinity maxima, whereas eddies in the subtropical areas generally have deeper anomaly maxima, presumably inherited from their origin in the boundary currents. The temperature and salinity signatures of the average eddy suggest that their tracer anomalies are a result of both trapping in the eddy core and stirring.

It is shown, through an idealized example and results from a quasi-geostrophic model, that sea level skewness can be used to identify the mean path of unstable ocean jets and also regions dominated by eddies with a preferred sense of rotation. These ideas are confirmed with a more detailed analysis of the skewness fields for the northwest Atlantic and Agulhas Retroflection region.

	abstract={The role of eddies in modulating the Southern Ocean response to the southern annular mode {(SAM)} is examined, using an ocean model run at multiple resolutions from coarse to eddy resolving. The high-resolution versions of the model show an increase in eddy kinetic energy that peaks 2–3 yr after a positive anomaly in the {SAM} index. Previous work has shown that the instantaneous temperature response to the {SAM} is characterized by predominant cooling south of {45{\textdegree}S} and warming to the north. At all resolutions the model captures this temperature response. This response is also evident in the coarse-resolution implementation of the model with no eddy mixing parameterization, showing that eddies do not play an important role in the instantaneous response. On the longer time scales, an intensification of the mesoscale eddy field occurs, which causes enhanced poleward heat flux and drives warming south of the oceanic Polar Front. This warming is of greater magnitude and occurs for a longer period than the initial cooling response. The results demonstrate that this warming is surface intensified and strongest in the mixed layer. Non-eddy-resolving models are unable to capture the delayed eddy-driven temperature response to the {SAM.} The authors therefore question the ability of coarse-resolution models, such as those commonly used in climate simulations, to accurately represent the full impacts of the {SAM} on the Southern Ocean.},

	abstract={The Southern Ocean south of {35{\textdegree}S} accounts for approximately half of the annual oceanic carbon uptake, thereby substantially mitigating the effects of anthropogenic carbon dioxide {(CO2)} emissions. The intensity of this important carbon sink varies considerably on inter-annual to decadal timescales. However, the drivers of this variability are still debated, challenging our ability to accurately predict the future role of the Southern Ocean in absorbing atmospheric carbon. Analysing mapped sea-air {CO2} fluxes, estimated from upscaled surface ocean {CO2} measurements, we find that the overall Southern Ocean carbon sink has weakened since \{\textasciitilde\}2011, reversing the trend of the reinvigoration period of the 2000s. Although we find significant regional positive and negative responses of the Southern Ocean carbon uptake to changes in the Southern Annular Mode {(SAM)} over the past 35 years, the net effect of the {SAM} on the Southern Ocean carbon sink variability is approximately zero, due to the opposing effects of enhanced outgassing in upwelling regions and enhanced carbon uptake elsewhere. Instead, regional shifts in sea level pressure, linked to zonal wavenumber 3 {(ZW3)} and related changes in surface winds substantially contribute to the inter-annual to decadal variability of the Southern Ocean carbon sink.},

	abstract={Numerical simulations suggest that submesoscale turbulence may transform lateral buoyancy gradients into vertical stratification, and thus restratify the upper ocean via vertical flow. However, the observational evidence for this restratifying process has been lacking due to the difficulty in measuring such ephemeral phenomena, particularly over periods of months to years. This study presents an annual cycle of the vertical velocity and associated restratification estimated from two nested clusters of meso- and submesoscale-resolving moorings, deployed in a typical mid-ocean area of the Northeast Atlantic. Vertical velocities inferred using the non-diffusive density equation are substantially stronger at submesoscales (horizontal scales of 1-10 km) than at mesoscales (horizontal scales of 10-100 km), with respective root mean square values of 38.0 {\textpm} 6.9 m/day and 22.5 {\textpm} 3.3 m/day. The largest submesoscale vertical velocities and rates of restratification occur in events of a few days’ duration in winter and spring, and extend down to at least 200 m below the mixed layer base. These events commonly coincide with the enhancement of submesoscale lateral buoyancy gradients, which is itself associated with persistent mesoscale frontogenesis. This suggests that mesoscale frontogenesis is a regular precursor of the submesoscale turbulence that restratifies the upper ocean. The upper-ocean restratification induced by submesoscale motions integrated over the annual cycle is comparable in magnitude to the net destratification driven by local atmospheric cooling, indicating that submesoscale flows play a significant role in determining the climatological upper-ocean stratification in the study area.},

In existing conceptual frameworks, the thermocline depth is determined by competition between the mean and eddy heat transport, with a contribution from the interaction with the stratification in the enclosed portion of the ocean. Using numerical simulations, this study examines the equilibration of an idealized circumpolar current with and without topography. The authors find that eddies are much more efficient when topography is present, leading to a shallower thermocline than in the flat case. A simple quasigeostrophic analytical model shows that the topographically induced standing wave increases the effective eddy diffusivity by increasing the local buoyancy gradients and lengthening the buoyancy contours across which the eddies transport heat. In addition to this local heat flux intensification, transient eddy heat fluxes are suppressed away from the topography, especially upstream, indicating that localized topography leads to local (absolute) baroclinic instability and its subsequent finite-amplitude equilibration, which extracts available potential energy very efficiently from the time-mean flow.},

Here we investigate the contributions of atmospheric wind fluctuations to the mean, variability and trend of {SO} wind stress over the last four decades using {NCEP} and {ERA-Interim} reanalysis products. Including wind variability at synoptic frequencies (2-8 days) and higher in the stress calculation is found to increase the strength of the mean {SO} wind stress by almost 40\% in both reanalysis products. The Southern Annular Mode index is found to be a good indicator for the strength of the mean wind and mean wind stress, but not as good an indicator for wind fluctuations, at least for the chosen study period. Large discrepancies between reanalysis products emerge regarding the contributions of wind fluctuations to the strengthening trend of {SO} wind stress. Between one-third and half of the stress trend in {NCEP} can be explained by the increase in the intensity of wind fluctuations, while the stress trend in {ERA-Interim} is due entirely to the increasing strength of the mean westerly wind. This trend discrepancy may have important climatic implications since the sensitivity of {SO} circulation to wind stress changes depends strongly on how these stress changes are brought about. Given the important role of wind fluctuations in shaping the {SO} wind stress, studies of the {SO} response to wind stress changes need to account for changes of wind fluctuations in the past and future.},

A key part of the overturning puzzle, however, is the return path from the interior ocean to the surface through upwelling in the Southern Ocean. This return path is largely driven by winds. It has become clear over the past few years that the importance of Southern Ocean upwelling for our understanding of climate rivals that of North Atlantic downwelling, because it controls the rate at which ocean reservoirs of heat and carbon communicate with the surface. The meridional overturning circulation of the ocean plays a central role in the climate and its variability.

Perturbing the model control sea surface temperature (SST) to mimic its change in response to doubling of CO2, it is shown that the associated ocean heat uptake (OHU) increases and penetrates deeper with the decrease of the mesoscale eddy transfer. It is shown that the OHU correlates with the AMOC strength, and both these quantities are affected by the mesoscale eddy transfer. Passive tracer experiments in the ocean model provide a possible explanation for the finding in coupled-model climate simulations that the ocean heat uptake efficiency (OHUE) increases with the AMOC strength and decreases with the eddy energy generated from the mean state. It is also found that the OHU in the SST-perturbation experiments scales with the net downward advection of heat.

Little is known, however, about how mixing varies on climate timescales. We present the first time-resolved global dataset of lateral mesoscale eddy diffusivities at the ocean surface, obtained by applying the suppressed mixing length theory to satellite-observed velocities. We find interannual variability throughout the global ocean, regionally correlated with climate indices such as ENSO, NAO, DMI, and PDO. Changes in mixing length, driven by variations in the large-scale flow, often exceed the effect of variations in local eddy kinetic energy, previously thought of as the primary driver of variability in eddy mixing. This mechanism, not currently represented in global climate models, could have far-reaching consequences for the distribution of heat, salt, and carbon in the global ocean, as well as ecosystem dynamics and regional dynamics such as ENSO variance.},

	abstract = {The Tasman Sea is a hot spot of ocean warming, that is linked to the increased poleward influence of the East Australian Current (EAC) over recent decades. Specifically, the EAC produces mesoscale eddies which have significant impacts on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the Tasman Sea. To effectively consider and explain potential eddy changes in the next 50 years, we use high‐resolution dynamically downscaled climate change simulations to characterize the projected future marine climate and mesoscale eddies in the Tasman Sea through the 2060s. We assess changes in the marine climate and the eddy field using bulk statistics and by detecting and tracking individual eddies. We find that the eddy kinetic energy is projected to increase along southeast Australia. In addition, we find that eddies in the projected future climate are composed of a higher proportion of anticyclonic eddies in this region and that these eddies are longer lived and more stable. This amounts to nearly a doubling of eddy‐related southward temperature transport in the upper 200 m of the Tasman Sea. These changes are concurrent with increases in baroclinic and barotropic instabilities focused around the EAC separation point. This poleward transport and increase in eddy activity would be expected to also increase the frequency of sudden warming events, including ocean temperature extremes, with potential impacts on marine fisheries, aquaculture, and biodiversity off Tasmania's east coast, through direct warming or competition/predation from invasive migrating species. Projected increase in the number and of warm‐core eddies in the EAC Extension Related to changes in baroclinic and barotropic instabilities near the EAC separation point Leads to nearly a doubling of eddy‐related southward heat transport by the 2060s},

Ever since, the idea that a temporary perturbation of the AMOC—or a permanent change in its forcing—could trigger an irreversible collapse has remained a reason for concern. Here we review literature on the equilibrium stability of the AMOC and present a synthesis that puts our understanding of past and future AMOC behavior in a unifying framework. This framework is based on concepts from Dynamical Systems Theory, which has proven to be an important tool in interpreting a wide range of model behavior. We conclude that it cannot be ruled out that the AMOC in our current climate is in, or close to, a regime of multiple equilibria. But there is considerable uncertainty in the location of stability thresholds with respect to our current climate state, so we have no credible indications of where our present‐day AMOC is located with respect to thresholds. We conclude by identifying gaps in our knowledge and proposing possible ways forward to address these gaps. It cannot be ruled out that the current or future AMOC is in a regime of multiple equilibria Determining the proximity of the AMOC to stability thresholds is a main research challenge Further research is needed to identify observable metrics that distinguish between an AMOC slowdown and a collapse},

	abstract = {Despite ongoing increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases, the Earth’s global average surface air temperature has remained more or less steady since 2001. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to account for this slowdown in surface warming. A key component of the global hiatus that has been identified is cool eastern Pacific sea surface temperature, but it is unclear how the ocean has remained relatively cool there in spite of ongoing increases in radiative forcing. Here we show that a pronounced strengthening in Pacific trade winds over the past two decades—unprecedented in observations/reanalysis data and not captured by climate models—is sufficient to account for the cooling of the tropical Pacific and a substantial slowdown in surface warming through increased subsurface ocean heat uptake. The extra uptake has come about through increased subduction in the Pacific shallow overturning cells, enhancing heat convergence in the equatorial thermocline. At the same time, the accelerated trade winds have increased equatorial upwelling in the central and eastern Pacific, lowering sea surface temperature there, which drives further cooling in other regions. The net effect of these anomalous winds is a cooling in the 2012 global average surface air temperature of 0.1–0.2 °C, which can account for much of the hiatus in surface warming observed since 2001. This hiatus could persist for much of the present decade if the trade wind trends continue, however rapid warming is expected to resume once the anomalous wind trends abate. The slowdown in global average surface warming has recently been linked to sea surface cooling in the eastern Pacific Ocean. This work shows that strengthening trade winds caused a reduction in the 2012 global average surface air temperature of 0.1–0.2 °C. This may account for much of the warming hiatus and is a result of increased subsurface ocean heat uptake.},

This disparity is not attributable to instrument error; long-term trends computed at adjacent sites often agree to within a few tenths of a millimeter per year. Instead, the differing estimates of global sea level rise appear to be in large part due to authors' using data from gauges located at convergent tectonic plate boundaries, where changes of land elevation give fictitious sea level trends. In addition, virtually all gauges undergo subsidence or uplift due to postglacial rebound (PGR) from the last deglaciation at a rate comparable to or greater than the secular rise of sea level. Modeling PGR by the ICE-3G model of Tushingham and Peltier (1991) and avoiding tide gauge records in areas of converging tectonic plates produces a highly consistent set of long sea level records. The value for mean sea level rise obtained from a global set of 21 such stations in nine oceanic regions with an average record length of 76 years during the period 1880–1980 is 1.8 mm/yr±0.1. This result provides confidence that carefully selected long tide gauge records measure the same underlying trend of sea level and that many old tide gauge records are of very high quality.},

	abstract = { Abstract Climate models show that most of the anthropogenic heat resulting from increased atmospheric CO2 enters the Southern Ocean near 60°S and is stored around 45°S. This heat is transported to the ocean interior by the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) with wind changes playing an important role in the process. To isolate and quantify the latter effect, we apply an overriding technique to a climate model and decompose the total ocean response to CO2 increase into two major components: one due to wind changes and the other due to direct CO2 effect. We find that the poleward-intensified zonal surface winds tend to shift and strengthen the ocean Deacon cell and hence the residual MOC, leading to anomalous divergence of ocean meridional heat transport around 60°S coupled to a surface heat flux increase. In contrast, at 45°S we see anomalous convergence of ocean heat transport and heat loss at the surface. As a result, the wind-induced ocean heat storage (OHS) peaks at 46°S at a rate of 0.07 ZJ yr−1 (° lat)−1 (1 ZJ = 1021 J), contributing 20\% to the total OHS maximum. The direct CO2 effect, on the other hand, very slightly alters the residual MOC but primarily warms the ocean. It induces a small but nonnegligible change in eddy heat transport and causes OHS to peak at 42°S at a rate of 0.30 ZJ yr−1 (° lat)−1, accounting for 80\% of the OHS maximum. We also find that the eddy-induced MOC weakens, primarily caused by a buoyancy flux change as a result of the direct CO2 effect, and does not compensate the intensified Deacon cell. }

Simulations show that the Southern Ocean south of 30°S, occupying 30\% of global surface ocean area, accounts for 43\% ± 3\% (42 ± 5 Pg C) of anthropogenic CO2 and 75\% ± 22\% (23 ± 9 × 1022 J) of heat uptake by the ocean over the historical period. Northward transport out of the Southern Ocean is vigorous, reducing the storage to 33 ± 6 Pg anthropogenic carbon and 12 ± 7 × 1022 J heat in the region. The CMIP5 models, as a class, tend to underestimate the observation-based global anthropogenic carbon storage but simulate trends in global ocean heat storage over the last 50 years within uncertainties of observation-based estimates. CMIP5 models suggest global and Southern Ocean CO2 uptake have been largely unaffected by recent climate variability and change. Anthropogenic carbon and heat storage show a common broad-scale pattern of change, but ocean heat storage is more structured than ocean carbon storage. The results highlight the significance of the Southern Ocean for the global climate and as the region where models differ the most in representation of anthropogenic CO2 and, in particular, heat uptake.},

	title = {{Trend and Variability in Global Upper‐Ocean Stratification Since the 1960s}}, 
	issn = {2169-9275}, 
	doi = {10.1029/2019jc015439}, 
	abstract = {Many studies on future climate projection point out that with progressing of global warming, upper‐ocean density stratification will strengthen over this century, and consequently, global‐averaged ocean primary productivity will decrease. Observed long‐term changes in the stratification to date, however, still show large uncertainties of the change itself and its driver. Focusing on the vertical difference in the emergence of the global warming signals, we used only observational profiles to describe the spatiotemporal characteristic of long‐term trend and variability in the upper‐ocean stratification (defined as the density difference between the surface and 200‐m depth). Statistically significant strengthening of the stratification since the 1960s was detected in \textbackslashtextasciitilde40\% of the global ocean area. The global average increase in the stratification corresponds to 3.3–6.1\% of the mean stratification. The strengthening trends considerably change depending on the regions and show dominant contribution from the tropical region. In addition to the well‐documented explanation of strengthening stratification, namely the surface intensification of global warming signal, we found that changes in subsurface temperature and salinity stratification associated with changes in atmospheric/ocean circulations significantly contribute to the long‐term change in the stratification and setting its regional difference. In midlatitude and high‐latitude ocean of the Northern Hemisphere, the long‐term trend exhibits noteworthy seasonality, which shows faster increase trend in the summer than in the winter. From the detrended time series, interannual variabilities correlated with a particular climate mode are detected in several ocean regions, suggesting that these variabilities are mainly driven by associated sea surface temperature variation. In general, upper‐ocean stratification (i.e., vertical changes in sea water density) serves as a barrier between relatively warm and nutrient‐depleted surface water and relatively cool and nutrient‐rich subsurface water. As a consequence of global warming, globally averaged upper‐ocean thermal stratification is thought to be enhanced due to the surface intensification of the warming signal. Strengthened stratification will have a large impact on oceanic biological activity through changes in light availability and vertical nutrient supply to the upper‐ocean phytoplankton community. Because investigations of the change in stratification are limited in ocean regions and have employed relatively short‐term observational data, large uncertainties remain. In this study we investigated the changes in stratification with as great a spatial and temporal coverage as possible, using only historically collected profile data. We found strengthened stratification in the large part of the global ocean with large spatial heterogeneity. Changes in the vertical structure of salinity and subsurface temperature contribute to the changes in density stratification, in addition to the surface intensification of the global warming signal. Statistically significant strengthening of the upper‐ocean stratification since the 1960s is detected in \textbackslashtextasciitilde40\% of global ocean area The global average increase in the stratification corresponds to 3.3–6.1\% of the climatological mean In addition to surface warming, changes in subsurface temperature and salinity structure significantly contribute to the long‐term change},

	abstract = {{Ocean circulation redistributes Earth’s energy and water masses and influences global climate. Under historical greenhouse warming, regional ocean currents show diverse tendencies, but whether there is an emerging trend of the global mean ocean circulation system is not yet clear. Here, we show a statistically significant increasing trend in the globally integrated oceanic kinetic energy since the early 1990s, indicating a substantial acceleration of global mean ocean circulation. The increasing trend in kinetic energy is particularly prominent in the global tropical oceans, reaching depths of thousands of meters. The deep-reaching acceleration of the ocean circulation is mainly induced by a planetary intensification of surface winds since the early 1990s. Although possibly influenced by wind changes associated with the onset of a negative Pacific decadal oscillation since the late 1990s, the recent acceleration is far larger than that associated with natural variability, suggesting that it is principally part of a long-term trend.}},

abstract = {{Some of the earliest unequivocal signs of climate change have been the warming of the air and ocean, thawing of land and melting of ice in the Arctic. But recent studies are showing that the tropics are also changing. Several lines of evidence show that over the past few decades the tropical belt has expanded. This expansion has potentially important implications for subtropical societies and may lead to profound changes in the global climate system. Most importantly, poleward movement of large-scale atmospheric circulation systems, such as jet streams and storm tracks, could result in shifts in precipitation patterns affecting natural ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources. The implications of the expansion for stratospheric circulation and the distribution of ozone in the atmosphere are as yet poorly understood. The observed recent rate of expansion is greater than climate model projections of expansion over the twenty-first century, which suggests that there is still much to be learned about this aspect of global climate change. The tropical belt has been widening over past decades — as estimated from a number of independent lines of evidence — shifting the dry subtropical climate zones polewards around the world.}},

abstract = {{The non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) statistical test has been popularly used to assess the significance of trend in hydrological time series. The test requires sample data to be serially independent. When sample data are serially correlated, the presence of serial correlation in time series will affect the ability of the test to correctly assess the significance of trend. To eliminate the effect of serial correlation on the MK test, effective sample size (ESS) has been proposed to modify the MK statistic. This study investigates the ability of ESS to eliminate the influence of serial correlation on the MK test by Monte Carlo simulation. Simulation demonstrates that when no trend exists within time series, ESS can effectively limit the effect of serial correlation on the MK test. When trend exists within time series, the existence of trend will contaminate the estimate of the magnitude of sample serial correlation, and ESS computed from the contaminated serial correlation cannot properly eliminate the effect of serial correlation on the MK test. However, if ESS is computed from the sample serial correlation that is estimated from the detrended series, ESS can still effectively reduce the influence of serial correlation on the MK test.}},
